Macaroni for C++ for the Internet
=================================

This is the website for Macaroni. Previously the entire website was stored as
part of Macaroni's normal repo but this made it difficult to casually edit
which meant often times I left out information or didn't properly talk about
which releases were currently available. Now the Macaroni code repo just
generates some of the docs while this repo stores the rest of the site.
